# Mud

Some drawings and pictures and things, in your browser

## Getting Started

Mud requires node+npm for managing dependencies and building

    $ npm install # installs dependencies and tooling

## Development/Usage

Use "npm run dev" to run a webpack development server

    $ npm run dev

While the dev server is running, you'll be able to see your work, updated as you save things, at http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

You can run the unit tests with

    $ npm test

And you can run them continuously with

    $ npm run watch-test
