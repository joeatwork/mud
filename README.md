Some drawings and pictures and things.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mud'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Development/Usage

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

Running 'bin/demo' will produce some sort of demo to stdout - an image or some other sort of file.

Here's the current demo:
